### Declarative vs Imperative

In this part, we explore one of the fundamental philosophies of React.

- **Imperative programming** tells the computer *how* to do things, step by step.
  - Example: Directly manipulating the DOM with document.createElement, appendChild, etc.

- **Declarative programming**, which React encourages, focuses on *what* the UI should look like.
  - Example: Writing JSX that describes the desired state of the UI.

React abstracts away the DOM manipulation, letting you focus on building components and describing the UI logic clearly.

ðŸ§  Key takeaway: React is **declarative** by design. You describe the result, and React handles the steps.
